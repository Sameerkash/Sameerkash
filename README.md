##### Long Version

Over the past 2 years, my main interests have been developing cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter and web apps using React.js and Next.js. I also have experience writing server-side JavaScript/TypeScript to build REST API endpoints as well as GraphQL APIs. Throughout my experience, Iâ€™ve built several projects with interesting challenges regarding state management, architecture, and design patterns while trying to explore optimal solutions around building real-world scalable full-stack applications.

I got the pleasure of working with two organizations helping them build their product as a Full Stack Intern and also got the opportunity to be a Fellow during the spring batch of [MLH Fellowship powered by Github](https://fellowship.mlh.io/#programs). I learned a ton of new technologies, concepts, and techniques such as pair programming that helped my team come up with successful sprint projects that won the hackathon. I also got the opportunity to be at GraphQL Asia 20 and Kubecon + CloudnativeCon 20,21.
I love collaborating and contributing to open source, which has helped me a lot as a software developer.

I recently started exploring the Blockchain space a few months ago and got selected to be a part of the Celo India Fellowship by [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co) this has helped so much to learn about the amazing impact blockchain will have on the way data is saved and stored in the near future, Celo is a mobile first Defi platform, I am contributing to Celo by porting their existing SDKs to dart, helping folks build flutter Dapps on Celo, I am doubling down on exploring and building the WEB3 ecosystem along with Flutter and trying to learn about different blockchains and the impact they will have
